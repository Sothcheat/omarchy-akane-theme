# Akane Theme

*Akane* (茜) — meaning *“madder red”* — captures the serene intensity of a world painted in shades of crimson and shadow. Inspired by traditional Japanese aesthetics, this artwork blends calm and chaos: a tranquil temple hidden within fiery autumn woods, under the watchful glow of a red sun.
It embodies the balance between stillness and motion, silence and passion — a reflection of nature’s quiet strength and timeless beauty.
